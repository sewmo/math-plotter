# Description
A minimalistic 500-line function plotter built in C with the SDL2 framework and the TinyExpr library.

# Specifications
This project was built with the **Simple DirectMedia Layer** framework (SDL2).  
It utilizes the **TinyExpr** library for expression parsing, compiling and evaluating, link to the library here: [TinyExpr](https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr?tab=readme-ov-file).
